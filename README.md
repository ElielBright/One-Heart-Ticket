## OneHeart Ticket Website - README
# Overview
The OneHeart Ticket Website is an initial template built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website serves as a foundational boilerplate for creating a ticketing platform. Users can browse events, select tickets, and view event details. This template can easily be converted into a React Web App by migrating the structure, styling, and functionality.

This boilerplate provides an easy-to-understand, modular code structure that can be adapted and extended to create a dynamic, scalable event ticketing platform with React.

# Features
- Responsive Design: The layout adjusts automatically for mobile and desktop screens.
- Event Listings: Displays events with details such as date, location, and available ticket types.
- Interactive Ticket Selection: Users can choose ticket options and view ticket information.
- React Ready: This template can be converted into a React app for better state management and scalability.
  
# Technologies Used
- HTML: Provides the structure and layout of the web app.
- CSS: Adds styling and ensures responsiveness across various devices.
- JavaScript: Enables interactivity for ticket selection and other dynamic features.
  
# How to Use
  Clone the Repository
  Clone the project using the following command:

  bash
   git clone https://github.com/ElielBright/One-Heart-Ticket.git
  cd One-Heart-Ticket

 # Open in Your Browser
  Open the index.html file in your preferred browser to view the app.

 # Customize the Template

  Modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to suit your needs.
  Change event details, ticket types, and any other content directly in the HTML and JavaScript files.
  
 # React Conversion Guide
 
 This template is designed to be easily migrated to a React Web App. To convert this into a React app:

 1. Set up a React Project
 You can use create-react-app or Vite:

 bash

 
 npx create-react-app oneheart-react
 # OR using Vite
 npm create vite@latest oneheart-react --template react
 
2. Migrate HTML to React Components

Break down the HTML into individual React components (e.g., EventCard, TicketSelection).
Create a new App.js and import your components.

3. Move CSS to React

Copy your existing CSS and import it into your React components (e.g., App.css).
Alternatively, use CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components.

4. Implement JavaScript Logic in React

- Convert the ticket selection logic and any other JavaScript functions into React's component state and event handling.
- Use React's state management (e.g., useState, useEffect) to manage dynamic data like event listings and ticket counts.
  
5. Run the React App
After migrating to React, run the app using:

bash


npm start
